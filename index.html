            <img src="images/Senior Picture.jpg" alt="me">
            <p>Hello! My name is Cassandra Heil and I am awesome! As a young aspiring programmer, I work hard to expand my knowlegde and gain experience to make myself valuable.
            This website was designed by me to polish out my skills. I hope you enjoy learning a bit about me!
            <br> <br>
            When I'm not working on my programming skills, I am playing video games, petting my pet rabbit, or enjoying the game of Dungeons and Dragons. Yep, you guessed it, I'm a nerd!
            Any Legend of Zelda game is my favorite game to play, half of the fun is the nostolgia and the other half is just the amazingness of the game. My bunnies name is Teemo. He is 
            white and adorable, with black tipped ears. Dungeons and Dragons is probably the most nerdy thing anyone can do but it is a very good way to be creative and bond with people.
            This is why I encourage people to try it.</p>
